Learn how to solve the most common coding challenges

In This repository we will cover the theorical part of the most common coding challenges. 

## Concepts

### Nodes

What is a node? They are fundamental building blocks of many computer science data structure. They form the basis of queues, trees and much more. In general, a contain data and links to other nodes. Let's imagine a node that contains a piece of data (a number) and a link to another node. 

The data contained wihin a node can be a variety of types, depending on the language you're using. So nodes can have numbers, strings, arrays or nothing

- Nodes contain data, which can be a variety of data types.
- Contain links to other nodes. If a node has no links or they are just null. You have reached the end of the path you were folling.
- Nodes can be orphaned if there are no existing link to them.
